This is an instruction on how to run the codes.


1. Download data.
First download the images and labels from  https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC.
Unzip all the images into a single folder named "images".
Image titles and labels are initially saved in the csv file, Data_Entry_2017.csv.


2. Spilt the dataset.
Run split_step1_p3.py to split the data in Data_Entry_2017.csv to 3 datasets, generating train.csv (70%), val.csv (10%) and test.csv (20%).

If you want to unsample some classes in the training dataset, run split_step2_p3.py. A new file named "resample_train.csv" would be generated.


3. Training.
In "Xray_train.py", set variables "label_dir", "image_dir" and "weight_dir" to appropriate path. "lable_dir" is where the .csv files are saved. "image_dir" is where the folder "images" locates. "weight_dir" is where the trained neural network weights to be saved.

Run Xray_train.py.

4. Validation and Test.
Run validation.py and pick the best trained model according to the AUROC.

Set BEST_EPOCH in "test.py" to be the epoch of the best model picked. 
Run test.py to get the AUROC on the test dataset. The result is reported in the table in "README.md".

5. Heatmap
Use notebook heatmaps.ipynb to generate heatmaps for input Xray images.
There are two parts in the notebook, generating two different heatmaps with different size of heat regions.
When running the notebook, be sure to change the path variables to be appropriate values in the begining of the notebook.

6. Miscellaneous stuff
ROC curves could be find in cam.ipynb.

7. Folder "TwoStagedDenseNet"
In this folder, a two staged densenet is implemented and these two stages are trained combinationally. 
However the performance is not improved comparing to the model used outside the folder "TwoStagedDenseNet".
The performace is roughly the same but not reported here.
