1. Dataset splitting.

   Image titles and labels are initially saved in the csv file, Data_Entry_2017.csv.
   
   split_step1_p3.py is used to split the data in Data_Entry_2017.csv to 3 datasets, generating train.csv (70%), val.csv (10%) and test.csv (20%).
   
   split_step2_p3.py is only used for upsampling the data in train.csv, resulting in resample_train.csv.
2. Network training.

   Use Xray_train.py to train the dense121 network.
   
3. Valadation
   Run validation.py.

4. Test
   Run test.py.
   
3. Network prediction.

 Â  cam.ipynb is the primitive code for showing the prediction result. Would be refined later.

4. Reference
